Since posting this recipe, having not used this recipe for a while, I made this mousse and for the first time added black cherries.  The mousse still tasted delicious, but the cherries being a lot heavier than strawberries sunk to the bottom - not a major problem; I still made sure that the mousse and cherries were evenly distributed between the parfait glasses.  But because the cherries had a lot more moisture in them than do strawberries, the consistency of the mousse was not as thick as I should have liked.  So I have amended the total quantity of liquid to 11/2-13/4 cups  Originally, I had specified TWO cups of liquid.  It's probably better to err on the side of adding a little less liquid - but it really does depend a lot on what fruit you are adding.""
